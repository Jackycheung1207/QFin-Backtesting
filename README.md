# Quantitative Finance 101: Backtesting and Optimization

Welcome to the Quantitative Finance 101: Backtesting and Optimization project. This project aims to demonstrate how to perform backtesting and optimization in the quantitative finance way.

## Getting Started
To get started, please check out the main.py script or the demo.ipynb notebook for instructions on how to use the code.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install the required packages using:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Project Structure
The project is organized in a clean and efficient manner, following a facade design pattern. Here's an overview of the structure:

* facade/: Contains the Backtester class and other core components.
* util/: Contains utility functions that support the main functionality.
* main/: Contains the primary scripts and notebooks for running the backtests and optimizations.
* result/: Stores the backtest and optimization results, including Sharpe ratio heatmaps and time series data for certain parameters.

## Usage

Running Backtests and Optimizations:
You can run the main.py script to perform backtesting and optimization.
Alternatively, use the demo.ipynb notebook to explore the functionalities interactively.

Viewing Results:
The results are stored in the result folder.
You can find Sharpe ratio heatmaps and time series data for various parameters within this folder.
